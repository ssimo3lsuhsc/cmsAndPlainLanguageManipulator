    <h1>About the Human Development Center</h1>
    <h2>What is the Human Development Center (HDC)?</h2>
    <p>The Mission of the Human Development Center (HDC) is to provide leadership and innovation in interdisciplinary
        education, community service, research, and to disseminate information to strengthen and increase the capacity
        of
        local communities to support and include individuals with developmental disabilities and their families in all
        aspects of life in the community.</p>
    <p>The Human Development Center (HDC) was established in 1974 and became a University Center of Excellence in
        Developmental Disabilities, Education, Research and Service (UCEDD) in 1984.</p>
