<h2>What is LEND?</h2>

<p>The Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND) is a nine-month interdisciplinary training program that incorporates both didactic and experiential learning in clinical and community-based settings. LA LEND prepares graduate students, family members, self-advocates, and practicing professionals to become future leaders in designing and implementing services, policies, advocacy, and consuming/conducting research and evaluation addressing the needs and priorities of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), other neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD) and developmental disabilities (DD) and their families.</p>

<p>There are&#160;<a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov/training/projects.asp?program=9" target="_blank">60 LEND programs</a>&#160;in every state, the District of Columbia, the United States Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and six Pacific Basin jurisdictions, either as an awardee or in partnership with a LEND program.&#160;As a LEND scholar, you will be connected to a national network of other programs throughout the nation. The Human Development Center leads the Louisiana LEND program. <a href="https://www.aucd.org/template/page.cfm?id=473" target="_blank">Learn more about the LEND programs from the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD) here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Too often professionals and parents do things to just get by, thereby perpetuating the status quo. If we are going to move the disability community forward, it&#8217;s imperative that we do so with the highest standards and I believe LEND supports that.</p>
